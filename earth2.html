        <p> our planet earth </p>
        <p> Earth is the planet where we live. It is the third planet among the eight planets of Sun and fifth largest among them. It is the only planet where human and other species can live. Essential substances like air, water and land supports life on earth.

            Earth is made of rocks and came into existence billions of year ago. However, 70% of the surface of the earth is covered by water which we see as the ocean, sea, and rivers and remaining 30% is covered by land.</p>
        <p> The Earth is a relatively small celestial object. It is the third planet orbiting an average star, our Sun, located in the Orion arm, sometimes called the Orion Spur; it is a minor arm located in between the Sagittarius Arm and the Perseus arm of the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy. Our solar system orbits the central bulge of our galaxy at a radius of 1.7 billion AU and our period of galactic revolution is 230 million years at a tangential velocity of 828,000 km/hr relative to the center. Our solar system has one main sequence star, 4 inner rocky planets, the asteroid belt, 4 outer large gaseous planets, the Kuiper Belt of small icy objects, and the outermost Oort Cloud of icy objects made of water, ammonia, and methane. It extends from</p>
        <p>Our planet and its resources make life possible on it. Without these resources, it is impossible to imagine life on earth. These resources are like sunlight, air, water, creatures thriving on/in them, minerals, and vegetation. But with the increasing level of pollution, these resources are either getting destroyed or depleted recklessly. It is very difficult to create a sustainable future on the earth and hence, we should start taking measures to save it.  </p>
